        <h4>Question via an online questionnaire</h4>

        <b>What is it:</b>
        <p>
            The candidate is given a set of multiple questions targeting a particular technology or framework.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes the questions are programming puzzles where you are asked to figure out an answer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Usually employed as a screening tool, pass or fail.
        </p>

        <b>Positives:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>can really get into the minute details of one particular technology</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Negatives:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>answers are often easily available online and they are usually part of the documentation for
                that particular piece of technology
            </li>
            <li>the programming puzzles rely on very specific details about the technology and are not a
                predictor for programming ability
            </li>
        </ul>
