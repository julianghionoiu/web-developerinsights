        <h4>Online programming puzzle</h4>

        <b>What is it:</b>
        <p>
            You send the candidate a link to a remote system where they are asked to implement the solution to a
            simple problem (usually algorithmic). It is predominately used for screening.
        </p>

        <b>Positives:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>you get to see a code sample</li>
            <li>the system automatically validates their submission, is objective</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Negatives:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>very limited insights. You are unable to prioritise the “best” candidates on this data</li>
            <li>some Developers will not perform at their best using an online environment</li>
        </ul>
