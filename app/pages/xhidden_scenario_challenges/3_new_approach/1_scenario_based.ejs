        <h4>Scenario based coding challenge</h4>

        <b>What is it:</b>
        <p>
            Simulates a real-world project in a compressed format.
        </p>
        <p>
            The candidate does this in their own time, using their laptop and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            The candidate is given a set of requirements that are changing over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starts like a take-home assignment, but a system is put in place so that when one set of
            requirements is completed, another one is sent to the candidate. The system will also validate the
            submissions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the challenge is complete, a developer will be asked to look at the candidate report which also
            contains the source code.
        </p>

        <b>Positives:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>identifies if the candidate consistently delivers quality code and good development technique
            </li>
            <li>identifies if the candidate is a fast developer</li>
            <li>provides insight into their testing strategy</li>
            <li>enables you to accurately compare candidates</li>
            <li>exposes the candidate's development technique</li>
            <li>provides insights into the candidate's delivery speed</li>
            <li>mimics real world development constraints</li>
            <li>candidates perform at their best as they are using their own IDE and tools</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Negatives:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>requires candidates to have a full working development environment. If you are hiring juniors,
                they might struggle with this
            </li>
            <li>format less suitable for testing experience with a particular framework</li>
        </ul>
