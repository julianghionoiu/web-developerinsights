        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Scenario based coding challenges deliver high quality predictive insights within a short period of
            time and will dramatically improve the quality of your hiring decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            When deployed as part of a hiring process optimised for maximum insights in minimum time, i.e.
            removing unnecessary upfront screening calls, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quickly and objectively identify developers who have proven they can deliver</li>
            <li>Expedite these developers to interview before your competitors</li>
            <li>Significantly increase your interview to offer ratio</li>
            <li>Reduce the risk of a bad hire due to poor coding skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In case you are wondering, our Developer Insights challenge is a scenario based coding challenge.
