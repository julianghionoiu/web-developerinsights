        <h4>Eliminate bias</h4>

        <p>
            Companies that are open to hiring diverse individuals from all
            types of backgrounds, have access to a larger pool of talent.
            Your goal should be to eliminate any form of discrimination from your hiring process.

            Developer <em>Insights</em>
            has been built to help you counter the negative effect of unconscious bias.
            Our reports do not reveal the candidateâ€™s identity.
            Only the person who emailed the challenge to the candidate will know which report is theirs.

            The decision to progress a candidate is solely based on their performance on the challenge.
