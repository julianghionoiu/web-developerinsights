        <h4> Confidently know your candidates’ speed and development technique</h4>

        <p>
            When you hire a developer, you rely on them to deliver fast clean code.
            But if you don’t have data on how fast they code or their development technique, the chances of
            making a bad hire are quite high.
            Developer <em>Insights</em> eradicates this risk.
