        <h4> Reduce the time you spend recruiting by 50%</h4>

        <p>
            Most companies have a two-stage assessment process, e.g.
            an online test followed by a take-home exercise.
            This lengthens the hiring process without really giving you true
            insights into a candidateâ€™s speed and technique.

        <p>However, as a one stage coding challenge, Developer <em>Insights</em> does better job than
            two traditional challenges combined. Essentially, it halves the recruitment time.</p>

            Additionally, by assessing candidates up-front with
            Developer <em>Insights</em>,
            you are uncovering which of them have the skills you require.
